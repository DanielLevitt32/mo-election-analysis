Trump victory most dominant in 20 years

Donald Trump swept to victory in the 2016 election with 306 Electoral College votes to Hillary Clinton's 232. By running such a controversial campaign, a common talking point leading up to election day was how much Trump's divisive rhetoric would affect Republican candidates on the down ballot. While it is true that senator Roy Blunt and governor Eric Greitens did both receive a lower percentage of the vote than Trump, it was stil lenough for both of them to win their respective races. Below we take a look at the last four elections where the U.S. president, U.S. Senate and Missouri governor races have all aligned in the same year, and see how 2016 differed from the past.

Donald Trump took Missouri by a 16-point margin, the largest by a Republican since Bill Clinton won the state in 1996. Trump dominated all but three counties and St. Louis City, and it wasn't ever close. The race for the U.S. senate was far closer than for president. In the weeks prior to the election, Jason Kander crept closer and closer to Roy Blunt in the polls, but ended up falling short, as Blunt took the seat by three percentage points. Looking at the results map, however, it didn't look as close. Eric Greitens and Chris Koster's race for Missouri governor was a six-point victory for Greitens, and the result map looked remarkably similar to the race for governor.
